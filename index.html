            <p> 
                I grew up in a small town in Central Florida. The kind of small town where you couldn't go anywhere and
                not run into somebody you knew. I have fond memories of going to the grocery store with my father, and
                every time being introduced to someone he knew - somehow. I thought he was the most popular man on the
                planet. My father, and both of my grandfathers had work ethics like you would not believe. They were
                some of the most intelligent men I would ever have the pleasure of knowing. These men were my biggest
                role models. From the time I could hold myself upright in a seat, one of my grandfathers, who I had
                nicknamed "Papa Orange," had me in the passenger seat of his Cessna 172. This man and his plane are the
                reasons I chose to pursue the career path I had originally set out on.
                <br>
                <br>
                At an early age, I had developed an addiction, or "sickness" as my grandfather referred to it as, to
                looking upward to the sky when I heard the roaring of an overhead engine. Flying with him in his Cessna
                was my release. It was what I'd default to, whether I was not having a great day, or just wanted to have
                fun. There was something about the feeling of it that I found exhilarating. For the longest time, I
                knew... as long as I could just be around planes I would be happy with whatever career path I was to
                take. My cousin graduated from Parris Island in 2007 and told me of this program he would be starting
                soon that would allow him to eventually become an officer in the United States Marine Corp and begin
                flight school. The thought of this made the hair on my arms stand at attention. I told myself, "This
                doesn't have to be a dream anymore."
                <br>
                <br>
                Fastforward a few years - I am graduating high school and am prospecting potential colleges. One
                university in particular caught my eye largely in part to a program they had with another university. I
                would attend 3 years, majoring in either Math or Physics and then transfer to the second university
                where I could finish that degree and also only have a few more courses to take to obtain an Engineering
                degree, all while working towards my end goal: flying jets.
                <br>
                <br>
                During my time at the first university, I was playing football and had made some incredible friends. One
                of which was a Computer Science major. He told me I should check out a couple of programming courses,
                since they of course, would count for electives in my program. I gave it a shot and was genuinely
                enjoying myself. I have always loved solving puzzles and learning new things and this captured both of
                those things and combined them. (Not quite finished writing my book of an About Me section)
